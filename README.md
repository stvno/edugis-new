edugis-new
==========

New version of the edugis kaart viewer based on D3 to include real GIS functionality like projections, classifications, buffering etc. Currently it is very much a sandbox for experimenting with different libraries to see what is possible.

In the end it should result in a flexible yet powerfull data-first webmap library.
